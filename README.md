# After Effects Expression Selector


## How it works

### Legend

| Name  | Description | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Expression  | Determines the Range and Amount of the Effect | [x,y,z] |
| Based On  |Determines the Unit of the Range | Characters / Characters Excluding Spaces / Words / Lines |
| Effect |The Effect on selected parts of the text | / |
| Amount | If not overwritten by the Expression, controls the Amount of Effect applied | [x,y,z] |

Instead of the Start and End-Sliders of the Range selector, an Expression is used to select a Range in the Source Text. Per _Based On_-Unit, a different amount of _Effect_ can be applied.

>#### Note:
> For simplicity's sake, I will only be using the _Based On_-Unit **Characters** in this explanation. Of course, the same applies for all other units.

### Unique Variables

There are three variables unique to the Expression Selector:
| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `textTotal` | the total number of Characters, starting at 1 |
| `textIndex` | the index of each Character, starting at 1 |
| `selectorValue` | the value of a Range Selector, if exists |

### Introduction
Let's just jump straight into a crude but useful example to illustrate how this works.

<sub>Text Layer > Expression Selector > Amount</sub>

```javascript
  if(textIndex==1) {
    0
  } else if(textIndex==2) {
    25
  } else if(textIndex==3) {
    50
  } else if(textIndex==4) {
    75
  } else if(textIndex==5) {
    100
  }

```

As you can see, we used an If Statement to check for the textIndex. For each textIndex, we've returned a different number.
This is the percentage of how much _Effect_ is applied to the specified range. For `textIndex==1`, it's 0% — hence the first character is completely unaffected. `textIndex==5` is 100% affected, so the full 90° Rotation and Green Color are applied. The states inbetween are automatically interpolated.

>#### Note:
> Return `-100` to have the exact opposite effect applied.

Think of it this way: This whole block of code is executed for each Character in the Source Text. That's why we can ask for the value of `textIndex` five times and get different results for each Character.

In Javascript Talk, this is essentially what's going on:
```Javascript
for(let textIndex=1;i<textTotal;textIndex++) {

  // Expression Selector Code
  
}
```

### Simplify
To simplify the above code, we could do the following:

```javascript
(textIndex-1)*25;
```

And to make this fully dynamic, I'll divide `100%` by `textTotal`. This will then work for any amount of Characters.

```javascript
(textIndex-1)*(100/(textTotal-1));
```


>#### Note:
>Since both `textIndex` and `totalText` start at `1`, I'm subtracting `1` to get the first Character to be `0%`.

### Select Specific Character
<sub>Text Layer > Expression Selector > Amount</sub>
```javascript
// make sure "based On" is set to "Characters"
const characterToSelect = "*"; // change character here
const str = text.sourceText.replace(/[\r\n]/gm, ''); // remove line breaks
str[textIndex-1]==characterToSelect ? 100 : 0;// select character
```

### Select Specific Word

```javascript
// make sure "based On" is set to "Words"
const wordToSelect = "and";
const words = text.sourceText.replace(/[\r\n]/gm," ").split(" ").filter(n => n); // split into words 
words[textIndex-1]==wordToSelect ? 100 : 0;// select if match
