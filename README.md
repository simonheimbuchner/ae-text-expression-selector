## How it works

#### Disclaimer
>This repo was created by trial and error. Since there is little information on the Text Expression Selector, some information might be incomplete or flat out wrong.

### Legend

| Effect |The Effect on selected parts of the text | / |
| Expression  | Determines the Range and Amount of the Effect | [x,y,z]
| Amount | If not overwritten by the Expression, controls the Amount of Effect applied | [x,y,z] |

Instead of the Start and End-Sliders of the Range selector, an Expression is used to select a Range in the Source Text.

#### Note
> For simplicity's sake, I will only be using the _Based On_-Unit **Characters** in this explanation. Of course, the same applies for all other units.

### Unique Variables

There are three variables unique to the Expression Selector:
| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `textTotal` | the total number of Characters, starting at 1 |
| `textIndex` | the index of each Character, starting at 1 |
| `selectorValue` | the value of a Range Selector, if exists |

### Introduction
Counterintuitively, the _Amount_ Property and its Expression are not linked like they would usually be. Let's ignore this _Amount_-Value for just now—we'll focus on coding an Expression to select some Characters and change their appearance. 
Let's just jump straight into a crude but useful demonstration to illustrate how this all works.

### Setup
In this example, we've got five Characters in a text Layer. In this expression we'll select each Character individually and return a number between `0` and `100`—these are the percentages of how much Effect is applied.

<sub>Text Layer > Expression Selector > Amount</sub>

```javascript
  if(textIndex==1) {
    0
  } else if(textIndex==2) {
    25
  } else if(textIndex==3) {
    50
  } else if(textIndex==4) {
    75
  } else if(textIndex==5) {
    100
  }

```

This is what that looks like: A gradual increase of effect. On the fifth Character (where `textIndex==5`), `100%` of the Effects are applied.

#### Note
> Return `-100` to have the exact opposite effect applied.

Think of it this way: This whole block of code is executed for each Character in the Source Text. That's why we can ask for the value of `textIndex` five times and get different results for each Character.

In Javascript talk, this is basically what's going on under the hood.
```Javascript
for(let textIndex=1;i<=textTotal;textIndex++) {

  // Expression Selector Code
  
}
```

### Simplify & Formularize
With that knowledge, we can simplify the crude If Else-code from above like this:

```javascript
(textIndex-1)*25;
```
Using `textIndex-1` (numbers between `0` and `4`) and multiplying them by 25, we'll get to each of the previously hard coded percentages of `0%-100%`. I'm subtracting `1` to have the first Character be `0*25=0`.

And to make this fully dynamic, I'll divide `100%` by `textTotal` to get to the split percentages.

```javascript
(textIndex-1)*(100/(textTotal-1));
```

Now, this code works with any amount of Characters.

### Using the Amount Slider

If no expression overrides the value, the Expression will default to _Amount_.
If you do override it, you can access it using `value`.

This, for example, is how you would reverse the _Amount_-Slider:
```javascript
[100,100,100]-value;
```
You can also use this to your advantage by animating _Amount_ and then staggering the animation using `valueAtTime()`. You'll find this code in the [Examples](/Examples).

### Dimensions
_Amount_ is a three-dimensional property: `[x,y,z]`.

Effects by default have either one or two dimensions. `Opacity` has one (`[x]`), `Position` has two (`[x,y]`),  and if you enable _Enable Per-character 3D_ in the Animator, all sorts of properties gain a third dimension (`[x,y,z]`), too. 

Both _Amount_ and the Effects work with these dimensions. An amount of `[100,0,0]`, for example, will only affect every first dimension of the added Effects, leaving the `z` and `y`-Axis untouched.

This is a difficult thing to wrap your head around, especially when dealing with Properties like Colors. It can be quite useful for more complex rigs, though.
